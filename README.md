# Cubic-B-Spline-Interpolation


This repository contains a python implementation of cubic B-spline interpolation.The code allows you to generate a smooth curve that passes through a given set of control points.

















## Introduction
Cubic B-spline interpolation is a numerical method used to approximate a curve based on a set of control points. It is commonly used in computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and data visualization.

This implementation provides the necessary functions to perform cubic B-spline interpolation, including generating the knot vector, evaluating basis functions, and interpolating points.
